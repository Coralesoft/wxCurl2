# wxCurl2 - wxWidgets library to connect to Curl

Based on well-known wxCode component wxCurl
Author: Francesco Montorsi

# What was done

Because this library never was supported. I couldn't find any of authors and supporters, I've created this branch.
I fixed several bugs (concerning http behaviour) and moved to https (secure HTTP) protocol that was currently unsupported.

# Dependences

In order to compile you will need to compile CURL library.
